# System Requirements

This repository uses open-source EDA tools that are supported on Ubuntu 20.04 or later. While other Linux distributions may work, Ubuntu is recommended for optimal compatibility. If your system doesn't run Ubuntu natively, you can install it via a virtual machine (VM) to get started easily.

For Windows users, we suggest Oracle VM VirtualBox. For macOS users, UTM is a great option. Feel free to use any VM software that suits your needs. To ensure smooth performance with the EDA tools, we recommend the following VM specifications:

- **RAM:** 6 GB
- **Storage:** 50 GB
- **OS:** Ubuntu 20.04 or later (prefer LTS versions for stability)
- **vCPU:** 4

### Alternative Setup
While VMs are user-friendly, they split resources between Windows/macOS and Ubuntu, which can impact performance. Hence dual-booting Ubuntu, allows direct hardware access without virtualization overhead. 

#### For Apple Silicon Macs

#### Note: 
I have installed Ubuntu 24.04 on my M1 Mac (8GB, 256GB) using Asahi Linux and have allocated 70GB
