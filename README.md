# RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program by VSD

This repository documents my journey through VSD's RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program, featuring week-to-week task submissions along the way. The aim of the project is to design, implement, and tape out a System on Chip (SoC) using robust open-source VLSI methodologies, providing practical exposure to the complete digital design flow from specification to GDSII for fabrication.
